# A sandbox for learning Windows Console API, focusing on creating animations for the CLI.
## Major issues:
  - I'm using a yucky ``` while true ``` which should be replaced with an event driven approack 
## ball.cpp:
  this is a simple render of a circle by drawing each cord of the circle and then moving the circle inversely with the window thus creating the illusion that the circle is floating.
